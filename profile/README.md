## Hi there 👋

Our hobby is searching: as a skill, as an art, as a way of thinking. <br />
We are engaged in the discipline of OSINT, which is used in one way or another in many areas of our lives. The community is named after it: open source intelligence as a way of thinking. <br />
<br />
Together with like-minded people, we are developing an independent OSINT community in Russia. We teach OSINT, conduct meetups, develop tools and make investigations. <br />
<br />
Join us in developing and supporting new OSINT tools! 🔍✨
